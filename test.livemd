# Elixir School - Collections

## Lists

Lists are simple collections of values which may include multiple types; lists may also include non-unique values:

```elixir
list = [3.14, :pie, "Apple"]
```

Elixir implements list collections as linked lists.
This means that accessing the list length is an operation that will run in linear time (`O(n)`).
For this reason, it is typically faster to prepend than to append:

```elixir
# Prepending (fast)
["π" | list]
```

```elixir
# Appending (slow)
list ++ ["Cherry"]
```
